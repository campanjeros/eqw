TODO
====

* Make sure the pool crashes on bridge or behaviour errors
* Tweak all supervisor maximum restart frequency
* Handle pause/resume [X]
* Check error handling in callback behaviours
* Dynamic configuration of pools via facade
    - Num pollers (means being able to shut them down gracefully)
    - Max workers per poller
* Stats per pool
    - Poller must be passed PoolIdRef to be able to do this
* Add CT test suites (using some simple mq)
    - Implement simple disk MQ through bridge interface
* Figure out how and where to add/put standard bridges
    - Assert the input (map/proplist)
    - Bridge folder under src/priv
    - All bridges must be highly configurable to be standard
    - Bridge behaviour should reflect this, always take a map in setup/1
    - Make bridge timeout callback optional
* facade: get total num of pollers
* facade: get total num of workers and timers
* eqw_timer might be better suited as an actual, timer (timer:apply_interval)
    - Started by worker
    - Ensure automatic cleaning if worker dies
* gen_eqw_bridge:
    - recv should not take a number of messages, but should return a list of
      messages. This is because weather the recv is bulk or not is up to the
      bridge to decide and should be set in the bridge state.
* LATER: Maybe implement waiter/responder pattern (push, not pull)
* LATER: Bridge support for queue metadata
    - queue length
    - queue dispatch (but not acked)
