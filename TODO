# Todo
 - [ ] Bridge:setup/1 -> {ok, State} should be done in pool upon init
       not in every poller
 - [ ] Should support generic send message
 - [ ] Add specs and documentation to facade
 - [ ] Add README.md
 - [ ] Make sure the pool crashes on bridge or behaviour errors
 - [ ] Tweak all supervisor maximum restart frequency
 - [X] Handle pause/resume
 - [ ] Check error handling in callback behaviours
 - [ ] Dynamic configuration of pools via facade
    + [ ] Num pollers (means being able to shut them down gracefully)
    + [ ] Max workers per poller
 - [ ] Stats per pool
    + [ ] Poller must be passed PoolIdRef to be able to do this
 - [ ] Add CT test suites (using some simple mq)
    + [ ] Implement simple disk MQ through bridge interface
 - [ ] Figure out how and where to add/put standard bridges
    + [ ] Assert the input (map/proplist)
    + [ ] Bridge folder under src/priv
    + [ ] All bridges must be highly configurable to be standard
    + [ ] Bridge behaviour should reflect this, always take a map in setup/1
    + [ ] Make bridge timeout callback optional
 - [ ] facade: get total num of pollers
 - [ ] facade: get total num of workers and timers
 - [ ] eqw_timer might be better suited as an actual timer:apply_interval/3
    + [ ] Started by worker
    + [ ] Ensure automatic cleaning if worker dies
 - [ ] gen_eqw_bridge:
    + [ ] recv should not take a number of messages, but should return a list of
          messages. This is because wheater the recv is bulk or not is up to the
          bridge to decide and should be set in the bridge state.
 - [ ] LATER: Maybe implement waiter/responder pattern (push, not pull)
 - [ ] LATER: Bridge support for queue metadata
    + [ ] queue length
    + [ ] queue dispatch (but not acked)

# To Test
 - [ ] How to use topics
